The figure below shows the relative percent of programming language usage 
according to the 2012 survey. Languages with a total frequency less than 5 have 
been excluded for clarity. This figure shows the three most popular programming 
languages in bioinformatics are dynamic scripting languages. The most popular 
language in bioinformatics is R, a functional language aimed at data analysis. 
This highlights the importance of data analysis and hypothesis testing in 
bioinformatics.

The following figure compares the relative percentage point (pp) change in 
programming language usage between the 2012 and 2008 surveys. Languages with 
less than 2 pp change have been excluded for clarity. It should be noted that 
the questions about programming languages usage in 2012 and 2008 differed slightly.

This figure shows the strong increase in Python usage possibly at the expense 
of Java and Perl. Shell scripting is also on the increase which may suggest 
more bioinformaticians are becoming familiar with Unix and the command line. 
The increase JavaScript and PHP is also suggestive of a trend for increasing 
web-based development in bioinformatics.
