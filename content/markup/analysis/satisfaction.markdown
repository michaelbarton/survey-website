The figure below compares personal satisfaction with job position. Satisfaction 
was rated on a discrete scale from 0-9. The figure show the median and median 
absolute deviation (MAD) for level of satisfaction. Combinations of factors 
with than 10 responses have been excluded.

I think this figure shows a general trend for most bioinformaticians responding 
with a '7' for satisfaction. There are no stark deviations, for example PhD 
students do not appear to be any unhappier, except possibly in South America. 
Masters degree students in bioinformatics do however have a greater range 
suggesting that perhaps an 'either you love it, or hate it' effect. Comments 
welcome below.
