> Bioinformatics has become too central to biology to be left to specialist bioinformaticians. Biologists are all bioinformaticians now.

<cite><a href="http://genomebiology.com/content/9/12/114">Lincoln D Stein, Genome Biology 2008</a></cite>

What is bioinformatics? What defines a bioinformatician? What areas are being
researched in bioinformatics? Does a big salary make you happy? What does it
take to be successful?

This survey aims to understand the field of bioinformatics by examining the
people whom work in it. Salary, success, publications, research topics and
happiness will be looked at.

We're currently planning what data to collect for the survey. You can help us do this
by forking and updating the survey [aims] and [questions] on
github. You can also email thoughts and suggestions to the [bioinfomatics
survey mailing list][mailinglist].
