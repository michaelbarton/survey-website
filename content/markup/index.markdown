> Bioinformatics has become too central to biology to be left to specialist bioinformaticians. Biologists are all bioinformaticians now.

<cite><a href="http://genomebiology.com/content/9/12/114">Lincoln D Stein, Genome Biology 2008</a></cite>

What is bioinformatics? What defines a bioinformatician? What areas are being
researched in bioinformatics? Does a big salary make you happy? What does it
take to be successful?

This survey aims to understand the field of bioinformatics by examining the
people whom work in it. Salary, success, publications, research topics and
happiness will be looked at.

We're currently finalising the survey questions and aims. You can get involved
in this project by forking and updating the [survey on github][github]. You can
also email thoughts and suggestions to the [bioinfomatics survey mailing
list][mailinglist].
