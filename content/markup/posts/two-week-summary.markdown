  title: Two weeks of responses

I started the bioinformatics survey two weeks ago. Thank you to everyone who 
has filled in the questionnaire so far, every response is appreciated and helps 
generate usable data about the bioinformatics field. I've plotted total number 
of results against days of survey collection in the figure below. This shows 
responses so far have outpaced the results for the previous 2008 survey in the 
same period.

The previous 2008 survey however received two bursts of results after 5 and 20 
days. You can see this as the total number of responses showing a higher slope 
compared to the preceding days. I would guess that this is result of additional 
traffic being generated on blogs and websites. This means at the present rate 
this year's survey will not match the number of responses compared with 2008.

I plotted the websites sending visitors to complete the survey
using available Google Analytics data. The figure below shows the number of 
survey completions against traffic source. This figure shows that the primary 
source of visitors, other than direct visits, is the [BioStar bioinformatics 
Q&A site][BioStar] which has generously added a banner. A [blog post by Grant 
Jacobs][post] also generated 10 responses showing the effect of blogging on 
survey participation.

Also using Google Analytics data I plotted the global location of survey 
respondents. I put a threshold of at least 5 responses from each country for 
clarity. This figure shows that bioinformaticians completing the survey are, on 
the whole, from the western world.

A quantitative bar chart of the same data shows that the two main countries 
generating responses are the US and France. The large number of responses from 
France must be attributed to [Pierre Lindenbaum][pierre] who has been promoting 
the survey on French mailing lists.

The lack of responses from the rest of the world is disappointing. I think
responses from across the world are important to give an accurate global 
representation of being a bioinformatician. For instance the lack of results 
from China and India is particularly disappointing given that these are two 
emerging countries with corresponding emerging bioinformatics cultures. I think 
greater representation from Africa and South America would be great too.

### Summary

The survey has had a great start but the number of results is slowing down 
compared with 2008. At the present rate this year's survey will not match the 
results compared with the previous 2008 survey. Furthermore bioinformaticians 
from the US, France, the UK, Canada and Germany represent 80% of the survey 
responses. Therefore the survey data will be correspondingly skewed towards 
these countries.

Any help with increasing survey participation is appreciated. You can help 
increase survey collection by tweeting or mentioning the survey on your blog, 
particularly if you are from an under represented country. Any other 
suggestions toward increased participation are welcome in the comments too.
