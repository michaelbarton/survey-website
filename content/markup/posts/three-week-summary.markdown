  title: Three weeks of responses

The bioinformatics survey has been collecting responses for three weeks now. 
You can see from the figure below that we are still struggling to keep pace 
with responses from the 2008 survey. At the present rate the number of 
responses will only match or be slightly below that of the previous survey.

There has been a greater global diversity in responses including Argentina, 
Australia and India compared with the results [I reported last week][previous]. 
The responses are still however dominated by the western world. Africa and the 
Middle East are unrepresented, and I believe India and China are under 
represented. You can help increase survey participation by tweeting or blogging 
about the survey. Contacting any bioinformatics mailing lists is also very 
helpful for generating responses.

There is a strong gender specific bias in the survey results, as shown in the 
figure below. This may be representative of the field but I think greater 
representation of women in the survey is useful for generating a picture of 
both sexes.

Finally here's a figure I found quite interesting to generate, this shows the distribution of age with career position in bioinformatics. I think this figure speaks for itself but I'd like to highlight the large age ranges for post-docs and PIs. I think this suggests these may be the "terminal" career positions for many bioinformaticians.
