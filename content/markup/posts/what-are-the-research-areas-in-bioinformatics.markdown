  title: What are the bioinformatics research areas?

One question I asked in the 2008 survey was what area of bioinformatics you
worked in. The answer to this question was one of nine categories in [the scope
of the Oxford Journal of Bioinformatics.][scope] These categories were:

  * Genome analysis
  * Sequence analysis
  * Phylogenetics
  * Structural Bioinformatics
  * Gene Expression
  * Genetics and Population Analysis
  * Systems Biology
  * Data and Text Mining
  * Databases and Ontologies

These categories provide a limited range of answers for a large field. One
alternative is to [use the complete scope of research areas][expanded]. This
has the advantage that the top level domains match the areas from the previous
year which makes for direct comparison and also provides a much more complete
list of choices. The disadvantage is that is a much longer list of answers
which may be a chore to answer.

As far as I know there are no complete list of research areas in bioinformatics
which is something I found surprising. The closest thing to this is the [EDAM
ontology discussed in a question on biostar][edam].
