Publications and grants are important. The more publications and grants you 
publish and receive the better the researcher you are. How important are grants 
and publications though? I think we can the bioinformatics survey to try and 
quantify the effect of publications on your career.

What effects do amount of publications explain as an input variable. Will 
publishing more result in a bigger salary, faster promotions or a greater level 
of satisfaction?

Which factors result in a greater publication record. Are you more likely to 
publish more when you're younger, single and without children? Are certain 
research areas likely to lead to more publications? Does working longer hours 
lead correlate with more publications? Do happier bioinformaticians publish 
more?

Finally there is another factor to consider along side publications which is 
networking. Along with publications, networking is also considered to be 
central to a successful bioinformatics? How does networking stack up against 
publications and grants. Networking is difficult to quantify in an online 
survey along side concrete numbers of publications and grants. At best we can 
however ask how much of a priority networking is.
