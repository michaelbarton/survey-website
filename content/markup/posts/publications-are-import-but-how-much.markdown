  title: Publications are important, but how much?

Publications and grants are important, concretely the more you produce the 
better. Or so the pressure in academia goes, but exactly how important are 
they? I think the results of the bioinformatics survey can examine a variety of 
factors which may correlate with these two metrics. 

For instance what variables can lead to a greater number of publications? Are 
you more likely to publish when you're younger, single and childless? Do 
specific research areas generate more publications? Does working longer hours 
or how happy you are correlate with more publications?

What factors might be expected to increase as an effect of publishing more? A 
larger salary or faster promotion? Is publishing rewarded more in some 
countries compared with others? Given a perfect system I think we might expect 
the most published bioinformaticians to have the greatest rewards. However a 
weak correlation may not be surprising result either given possible variation 
from institution to institution in rewarding academics.

Altogether I think the results of the survey will however be able to answer a 
significant question for pursing an academic career: Publications and grants 
are important, but exactly how much?

See the planned list of [survey questions focused on publications and 
grants][questions].
