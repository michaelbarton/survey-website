  title: What defines a successful bioinformatician?

The variable with the most interest in 2008 career survey was salary. This is
understandable: you want to know how much you're going to get paid throughout
your career. The site [glassdoor.com][] is an example of this, allowing
employees to find out the salary at other companies through contributing their
own in exchange.

I think you can argue that salary alone however is not equivalent to success.
This [RSA video on motivation][motivation] suggests that a deep connection to
your job is more rewarding. Another example is [Steve Jobs's Stanford
commencement speech][speech], viewed [a million times after his
passing][views], highlighting the importance of working on what you love.

Success therefore could be measured using additional variables such as how
satisfied you are, the choice of what to work on, or being given the
encouragement to improve your craft. Finally I think it's sensible to also just
ask how successful you feel.

The primary aims of the 2008 survey was to provide a census of
bioinformaticians around a set of interesting variables. You can find a list
of these on the [original survey page][original]. I would like the 2012 survey
to build on this by adding further specific areas of interest. You can see the
outline these in [the survey aims][aims]. The first point I think should be
what factors lead to success. This way, I hope, we can define a career in
bioinformatics by more that just how much money you'll make.
