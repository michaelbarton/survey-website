What characterisitics define a successful bioinformatician? The most common
point of interest about the 2008 career survey was salary. This is
understandable since we all what to live in a nice house, by the things we
want, and do the things we want. However you might also argue that a lare
proportion of bioinformaticians are academics and money is the not their sole
motivation.

Therefore other metrics of success are also of interest. Two factors
immediately come to mind. The first is career progression: the path from
undergraduate student to professor or industry euqivalent. The second is
satisfaction or happiness.

The primary aims of the 2008 survey was to provide a census of
bioinformaticians and around a set of variables I included at the time. I would
like the 2012 survey to build on this with certain specific points of interest
rather than being just a broad survey. The first point I therefore think should
be focused around what makes a successful career. You can see the factors I
think should be survey around this in the aims file in the survey github
repository.

Publications and grants are another metric of success and I think worthy or a
separate blog post.
